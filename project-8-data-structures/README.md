# Project 8: Data Structures Toolkit

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 8 for the MHS Software Engineering class, focusing on fundamental data structures through building a Browser History Manager.

## Introduction

Project 8 involves learning four fundamental data structures by building components of a Browser History Manager:

1. **Stacks** - Back/forward navigation (LIFO)
2. **Queues** - Download queue manager (FIFO)
3. **Hash Tables** - URL cache (dictionary)
4. **Trees** - Bookmark organizer (hierarchical)

Each lab provides starter code with some functions implemented and others as TODOs for you to complete.

## Lab Files

| Lab | File | Data Structure | Description |
|-----|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | [`lab1_stacks.py`](lab1_stacks.py) | Stack (LIFO) | Browser back/forward navigation |
| 2 | [`lab2_queues.py`](lab2_queues.py) | Queue (FIFO) | Download queue manager |
| 3 | [`lab3_hash_tables.py`](lab3_hash_tables.py) | Hash Table | URL cache with O(1) lookup |
| 4 | [`lab4_trees.py`](lab4_trees.py) | Tree | Bookmark folder organizer |

## How to Complete Each Lab

Each lab file is structured in 4 parts:

### PART 1: PROVIDED CODE
- Study the implemented functions to understand how they work
- These are your examples to reference

### PART 2: YOUR CODE
- Implement the TODO functions
- Follow the requirements in each docstring
- Use the hints provided

### PART 3: EXTENSION CHALLENGES
- Optional extra challenges for advanced students
- Complete these after finishing Part 2

### PART 4: MAIN PROGRAM
- Run the file to test your implementations
- Uncomment the interactive menu to play with your code

## Running the Labs

```bash
# Run Lab 1 - Stacks
python lab1_stacks.py

# Run Lab 2 - Queues
python lab2_queues.py

# Run Lab 3 - Hash Tables
python lab3_hash_tables.py

# Run Lab 4 - Trees
python lab4_trees.py
```

## Data Structure Summary

| Structure | Type | Key Operations | When to Use |
|-----------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Stack | LIFO | push, pop, peek | Undo/redo, back button |
| Queue | FIFO | enqueue, dequeue | Task scheduling, downloads |
| Hash Table | Key-Value | get, set, delete | Fast lookups, caching |
| Tree | Hierarchical | add, find, traverse | File systems, categories |

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these labs, you will:
- Understand how structural elements are used in programming (SE-11-02)
- Apply safe and secure practices to store data (SE-11-04)
- Use appropriate data structures for different problems (SE-11-06)
- Implement tested, working solutions (SE-11-07)
